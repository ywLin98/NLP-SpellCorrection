# NLP-SpellCorrection
##### This is the coursework of NLP, in which a Noisy Channel Model is implemented to solve the spell correction problem. Please see spell_correction.pdf for detailed desciptions.

#### About the Files:
`testdata.txt` is a file containing 1000 sentences, within which there are 1 to 3 misspellings.  
`spell-errors.txt` and `count_1edit.txt` are files from [spell-errors](https://norvig.com/ngrams/spell-errors.txt), [count_1edit](https://norvig.com/ngrams/count_1edit.txt), respectively. These two files are used to create the confusion 	matrix of Noisy Channel Model.  
`vocab.txt` is a file containing words and punctuations that are not misspelling.
